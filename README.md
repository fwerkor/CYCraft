## Official Server

The connection address is [fwerkor.com](https://mc.fwerkor.com).

You can simply download the latest [Release](https://github.com/fwerkor/CYCraft/releases) witch has a launcher inside, and just run it!

Currently we use [LittleSkin](https://littleskin.cn/) as the server's auth method, you need to have an account there first to join our server.
